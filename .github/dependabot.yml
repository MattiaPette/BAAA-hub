# Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
# Documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file
#
# Note: This project uses pnpm workspaces. Dependabot scans from the root directory
# and will update all workspace package.json files and the shared pnpm-lock.yaml.
# Using 'npm' ecosystem works for all npm-compatible package managers including pnpm.
#
# Strategy to reduce PR spam:
# - Use aggressive dependency grouping to batch updates into fewer PRs
# - Lower open-pull-requests-limit to reduce concurrent PRs
# - Schedule updates weekly to batch changes
